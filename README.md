## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

I'm an AI/ML Engineer with nearly a year of hands-on experience building intelligent systems‚Äîfrom data collection and model development to deployment and integration. I specialize in **Natural Language Processing**, **Computer Vision**, and building **end-to-end ML pipelines**.

With a background in **Computer Science & Data Science**, and real-world experience in **chatbot development**, **model fine-tuning**, and **cloud deployment**, I‚Äôm always looking to push the limits of what machines can do.

üîç Currently exploring **LLMs**, **RAG pipelines**, **LangChain**, and **AI Agent frameworks** to build smarter, context-aware applications.

üöÄ I love tackling new challenges, working on meaningful projects, and collaborating with people who are just as curious about AI as I am.
